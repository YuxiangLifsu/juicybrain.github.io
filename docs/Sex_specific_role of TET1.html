										Drug addiction is a global epidemic that devastates individual lives and imposes a significant burden on 
										societies. Notably, there are distinct sex differences in various types of drug abuse and addiction. 
										For example, in cocaine addiction, although more males use the drug, females tend to show higher escalation rates, 
										use larger amounts, and experience more severe withdrawal symptoms, as well as higher rates of relapse. Thus, To investigate
										the underlying mechanisms of these differences is crucial for both understandiong of the eatiology of addiction and 
										developing personalized treatments.

										These discrepancies in drug addiction can be attributed to multiple factors, including social and cultural environments. Historically, 
										illicit drugs have been more accessible to males, contributing to the sex-biased prevalence. Meanwhile, biological factors stem from each individual's genome. 
										In addition to sex chromosomes, which guide sexual development and result in distinct sex hormones, epigenetic mechanisms play a crucial role at the interface 
										between genes, environment, and personal experiences. DNA methylation, an essential epigenetic pathway, involves the addition of a methyl group to the 5-position of cytosine 
										in the genome by DNA methyltransferases. The active turnover of methylated cytosine is facilitated by the DNA dioxygenase enzymes known as Ten-eleven 
										translocation (TET) enzymes. Previous studies have indicated that neuronal activity and cocaine use can lead to a loss of function of TET1 in neurons. 
										In this study, we discovered that deletion of TET1 in the Nucleus accumbens (NAc) dopamine receptor Drd1-expressing medium spiny neurons (D1-MSNs) leads
										to sex-specific cocaine addiction-like behaviors in males and females respectively. Notably, DNA methylation and 3D genome organization profiling suggest 
										that TET1-dependent, sex-specific epigenomic features could underlie these sex-specific behavioral phenotypes. Our research highlights TET1's 
										sex-specific roles in cocaine addiction and the associated sex-dimorphic epigenomic modifications in a key neuronal population.
